## Conditionals üîÑ

**Conditionals** allow you to execute different code based on conditions.

Basic syntax:
```javascript
if (condition) {
   // code to execute if condition is true
} else {
   // code to execute if condition is false
}
```

Example:
```javascript
if (age > 16) {
   console.log("You can drive!");
} else {
   console.log("Sorry. Too young!");
}
```

**Comparison Operators**:
- `<` : less than
- `>` : greater than
- `<=`: less than or equal to
- `>=`: greater than or equal to
- `===`: equal to
- `!==`: NOT equal to

Remember: Conditions should evaluate to either **truthy** or **falsy**.

## Compound Conditionals üîÑüîÑ

These allow you to check multiple conditions.

**Logical Operators**:
- `!`  : NOT
- `||` : OR
- `&&` : AND

Example with the AND operator:
```javascript
if (sky === "clear" && temp === "warm") {
   alert("Wonderful! Go enjoy the weather!");
} else {
   alert("Hmm. Consider staying home today.");
}
```

## Asking Technical Questions ‚ùì

When seeking help or discussing your code:
1. Provide context.
2. State the coding language you're using.
3. Share your code or screen.
4. Explain the current behavior vs. expected behavior.
5. Share any attempts you've made to solve the issue.

Example:
"On line 3 of my JS file, this function is returning `undefined`, but I want it to return the sum. Do you spot any errors?"

## Professional Portfolios üñºÔ∏è

**What's a portfolio?**
- A collection of work samples.
- Shows off your skills and achievements.
- Useful for job opportunities or sharing your work.

**Key Features**:
- Multiple HTML pages.
- Professional information about yourself.
- Links to past coding projects.
- CSS styling that matches your personality.

## Key Takeaways
